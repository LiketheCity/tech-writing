# Assignment Three: White Paper

In this assignment you will compose a **white paper**, defined for this class as a scientific/technical document written in order to communicate with the public rather than the scientific community. While scientific journal articles aim narrowly at a scientific audience, white papers are put out for a variety of purposes, with an audience consisting of scientists, professionals, and members of the general public. White papers draw on scientific research, but present it in an accessible manner using graphics and a clear takeaway or call to action.

White papers are widely used in industry, nonprofit, and government as a means of communicating with diverse audiences. They may sometimes be written by technical writers or other communications professionals, but often they are composed by scientists or subject matter experts. Business owners also benefit from composing them as a marketing tool. They may serve as a technical marketing tool, or, in a nonprofit or governmental context, as a means of public education. 

## Specifications

White paper scope and format vary widely. For this class, I will expect a 4-5 page document (1,000 to 1,500 words) with one image or illustration per page. The document should cite at least one source per page, the majority of which should be either peer-reviewed scientific journal articles or official sources of scientific/technical data. The paper should have a compelling title, use subheadings for organization, and provide a clear **call to action** at the end motivating your reader to learn more about the topic. 

You are free to choose a topic of interest to you, as well as to define your audience. In general, your audience should be broader than just experts in your field, but need not extend to the general public. For instance, you might write for scientists in a relevant related area or for non-technical managers in your field. You may also write for a broad public, though generally speaking you should remain focused on professionals or those with some level of knowledge, not (for instance) fellow students or those with no relevant interest in the topic.

In order to define your audience and call to action, you should write on behalf of an organization, company, or other entity. You can use your class blog for this purpose or identify another entity. 

The document should follow good design and typography practices as we discuss them in this class to create an attractive and consistent look. As this is course work, you are free to use others' images under fair use, but please be sure to provide appropriate credit to the original source.

Citations for all sources should be provided using your style sheet and format of choice. 

## Layout and Submission

You will produce a **research abstract** consisting of a list of potential sources (at least 8-10) with a paragraph describing what you are investigating and how the sources will inform your work.

The next stage in the project will be our usual one-paragraph **topic commitment,** followed by a draft for peer review. These preliminary documents should be submitted through GitHub using Markdown.

The final document should be produced in an appropriate typesetting program such as Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign. To convert from Markdown to one of these formats, either use the desktop tool [Pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org/) or the browser-based tool [Heroku](https://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/). It should be submitted **as a PDF** to preserve formatting and images. You can export a PDF from within Microsoft Word by using either the "Export" or the "Save As" function (depending on your version) under the "File" menu.

Add all documents to a repo entitled "White-paper" for submission.

## Rubric

The following rubric will be used to assess your grade. The final project is worth 400 points out of a total of 1,000 for the course.

A. Outstanding projects demonstrate a careful, detailed understanding of your field and your audience. They draw upon strong, authoritative research and communicate their findings in accessible but specific language and attractive illustrations. They are logically structured and provide a clear call to action. Mechanical/grammatical errors are minimal to nonexistent.

B. Projects performing significantly above the basic requirements do all the required tasks but with a level of sophistication above the basic requirements. This means a thoughtful approach to research and audience; effective design; and strong, clear prose. In general, they look like an outstanding white paper but with less care in audience analysis, content knowledge, or format.

C. Projects meeting the basic requirements fulfill all submission requirements and meet the expectations of the project for content, form, audience awareness, and mechanics. However, they do not go beyond a basic understanding of the material or audience, employ limited or inappropriate research, or use format and language in a rigid, formulaic manner. They may also demonstrate significant mechanical errors, while remaining comprehensible to the reader.

D. Such projects demonstrate minimal effort and limited sophistication in handling the assignment. They may merely rehash sources, doing just enough to avoid plagiarism; they may manifest a flimsy or overly broad grasp or research and audience; or they may demonstrate limited content knowledge or confusion about the appropriate form for the material. Their formatting and illustration may be hastily chosen or lacking in care. Major mechanical errors that disrupt the reader's understanding of and sympathy for the project may also place a project in this bracket.

F. These projects fail to meet even the basic requirements, either through failure to follow the prompt, limited engagement with content or audience, or persistent lack of clarity in form or mechanics.
