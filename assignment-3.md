## Rubric

The following rubric will be used to assess your grade. The final project is worth 200 points out of a total of 1,000 for the course.

A. Outstanding projects demonstrate a careful, detailed understanding of the your field and a strong concept for a blog that readers will actually want to read. They provide compelling content, whether educational, persuasive, or personal, with a strong authorial voice and relevant information. Each post has a reason for being and offers something distinct from others. Design choices are effective and thoughtful, and posts are written with effective titles and appropriate use of media. Errors in mechanics (grammar, punctuation, Markdown syntax) are minimal at worst, and all submission procedures are followed. 

B. Projects performing significantly above the basic requirements do all the required tasks but with a level of sophistication above the basic requirements. This means a thoughtful approach to the blog concept and strong, clear prose. In general, they look like an outstanding blog but with less care in audience analysis, content knowledge, or format.

C. Projects meeting the basic requirements fulfill all submission requirements and meet the expectations of the project for content, form, audience awareness, and mechanics. However, they do not go beyond a basic understanding of the material or audience, or use format and language in a rigid, formulaic manner. They may also demonstrate significant mechanical errors, while remaining comprehensible to the reader.

D. Such projects demonstrate minimal effort and limited sophistication in handling the assignment. They may merely rehash sources, doing just enough to avoid plagiarism; they may manifest a flimsy or overly broad blog concept; or they may demonstrate limited content knowledge or confusion about the appropriate form for the material. Major mechanical errors that disrupt the reader's understanding of and sympathy for the project may also place a project in this bracket.

F. These projects fail to meet even the basic requirements, either through failure to follow the prompt, limited engagement with content or audience, or persistent lack of clarity in form or mechanics.
